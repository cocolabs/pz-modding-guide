# Unofficial Guide to Modding Project Zomboid

This document will focus on explaining the methodology used to create, publish and install Project Zomboid modifications. The goal of this guide is to provide, as considered by author, the best way to create, publish and install Project Zomboid modifications. What is implied by *best way* is explained later in the guide.

This document is intended to be a complete guide that guides you through the process of modding various game aspects, providing detailed examples and explaining the reasoning behind the methodology used. If you are just looking for references, tutorials, code examples or a quick guide to creating simple modifications you should read [Project Zomboid Modding Guide](https://github.com/FWolfe/Zomboid-Modding-Guide) instead which serves more as an unofficial Project Zomboid wiki.
